# phi.database.sqlite

A set of SQL scripts together with DbUp console application for initializing Postgres-based database and control migration with simple SQL scripts.

## Database instantiation

$> docker-compose up -d
$> docker ps

Connect to the container and execute some internal commands to database engine:
$> docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID_HERE] bash
$> psql -U postgres

List databases:
$> \l
$> CREATE DATABASE mytestdb;
$> \l

Exit:
$> \q

To intialize database and connect to it:
$> cd phi.database.dbupmigrator.postgres
$> dotnet run

## See results

$> docker ps
$> docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID_HERE] bash
$> psql -U postgres
$> \c PhiDatabase
$> \dt
$> SELECT * FROM schemaversions;

Everything you have to do is [$>docker-compose up -d] and you are ready to go with all your databases + schema up to date! 
Also when I write integration tests I tend to play with database causing some rubbish data. It is really easy to [$>docker-compose down] and [$>docker-compose up] and have everyting fresh. 

See logs by [$> docker-compose logs].
