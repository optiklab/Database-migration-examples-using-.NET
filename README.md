# Phi.Storage

The idea is to get flexibility and full control in ways to initialize and migrate databases using various DB engines: SQL Server and SQLite supported.

To create SQLServer database, initialize it with some data, then connect to it and run tests:
$> cd phi.database.sqlserver
$> dotnet run
$> cd phi.repository.sqlserver.ef-scaffolded-model
$> dotnet run

To create SQLite database and initialize it with some test data, then connect to it and run tests:
$> cd phi.database.sqlite
$> dotnet run
$> cd phi.repository.sqlite.ef
$> dotnet run

The main different between two models is that [PhiUser] table in SQL Server is using [string] Identity Field, while SQLite model is using simple [integer] Identity.
This is done so due to performance reasons (in SQLite) and different use cases for those two engines (enterprise for sharding/partitioning vs. lightweight microservices).

## SQLServer storage (for future use)

### phi.database.sqlserver

A set of T-SQL scripts together with DbUp console application for initializing SQL Server-based database and control migration with simple SQL scripts.

### phi.repository.sqlserver.ef-scaffolded-model

Scaffoled (i.e. reverse-engineered) database model (POCO classes) using Entity Framework utilities and live SQL Server database generated with [phi.database.sqlserver] mentioned above.

### phi.repository.sqlite.ef - primer

Simple Entity Framework application that defines SQLite model and generates database with migration supported.

## SQLite storage (for decentralized and language-agnostic microservices)

### phi.database.sqlite

A set of SQL scripts together with DbUp console application for initializing SQLite-based database and control migration with simple SQL scripts.

### phi.repository.sqlite.ef

Entity Framework application that defines SQLite model and generates database with migration supported. It also able to connect to the database generated by [phi.database.sqlite] mentioned above.
